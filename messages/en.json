      "howItWorks": {
        "question": "How does Clean PicGo work?",
        "answer": "Clean PicGo uses two technologies to remove watermarks:\n\n1. **LaMa AI Model**: Works for all types of watermarks and unwanted objects, using deep learning to intelligently fill selected areas\n\n2. **Gemini-specific Algorithm**: For Gemini AI image watermarks, uses mathematically precise Reverse Alpha Blending for lossless pixel recovery\n\nAll processing is done locally in your browser - images are never uploaded to any server."
      },
      "geminiOptimization": {
        "question": "What optimizations are made for Gemini watermark removal?",
        "answer": "Compared to the original gemini-watermark-remover project, we've made these improvements:\n\n• **Watermark Detection**: Pre-checks if Gemini watermark actually exists before processing\n• **Numerical Stability**: Added Alpha ceiling protection to prevent division-by-zero pixel anomalies\n• **Automated Integration**: No manual mode switching needed, auto-detects and processes on upload\n• **Undoable Design**: Processing result saved as editing step, supports undo, can continue with AI model for other areas"
      },
      "lamaOptimization": {
        "question": "What optimizations are made for LaMa model processing?",
        "answer": "We've optimized LaMa model usage in several ways:\n\n• **Web Worker Background Processing**: Model inference runs in a separate thread, main thread stays completely responsive during processing\n• **Browser Caching**: Model files auto-cached after download, no re-downloading needed\n• **Progressive Editing**: Supports continuous editing, each result becomes the base for next edit\n• **Smart Masking**: Only processes user-painted areas, keeps everything else intact\n• **History Support**: Multi-step undo/redo, saves up to 30 history steps"
      },
      "privacy": {
        "question": "Are my images safe?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! All Clean PicGo processing happens locally in your browser:\n\n• Images never uploaded to any server\n• AI model runs in browser\n• We don't collect any user data\n• All data cleared when you close the page\n\nThat's why we say \"Processed entirely in your browser to protect your privacy.\""
      },
      "formats": {
        "question": "What image formats are supported?",
        "answer": "Clean PicGo supports common image formats:\n\n• **JPG/JPEG**: Most common photo format\n• **PNG**: Images with transparency support\n• **WebP**: Modern image format by Google\n\nProcessed images are exported as PNG by default for best quality."
      },
      "modelSize": {
        "question": "Why does the first load require a model download?",
        "answer": "LaMa is a professional deep learning model for image inpainting, with ~200MB model file.\n\n• **First use**: Download from CDN required, may take 1-2 minutes\n• **Subsequent use**: Model cached in browser, no re-download needed\n• **Gemini mode**: No model download needed, uses pure math algorithm\n\nDownload progress is shown in real-time."
      },
      "limitations": {
        "question": "Are there any limitations?",
        "answer": "Clean PicGo has some technical limitations:\n\n• **Image size**: LaMa model internally processes at 512×512, larger images are auto-scaled\n• **Gemini watermark**: Only removes visible semi-transparent watermarks, cannot remove SynthID or other steganographic watermarks\n• **Browser support**: Requires modern browser with WebGL (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)\n• **Processing time**: Depends on device performance, mobile devices may be slower"
      },
      "geminiSaveMethod": {
        "question": "Why does Gemini watermark removal fail for some images?",
        "answer": "This is usually related to how the image was saved:\n\n**Correct method**: After generating an image on Gemini / Nano Banana Pro, click the \"Download\" button to save. This preserves the original watermark information.\n\n**Incorrect method**: Using right-click \"Save As\" or \"Save Image\" may cause the browser to re-encode the image, altering or losing watermark characteristics.\n\n**Solutions**:\n• Regenerate the image and use the download button\n• If right-click saved images fail detection, try the universal AI eraser mode instead\n\nNote: This is due to how browsers process images, not a limitation of this tool."
